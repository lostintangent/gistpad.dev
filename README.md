# 📓 gistpad.dev

[Gistpad.dev](https://gistpad.dev) is a web app/PWA for managing and sharing your personal knowledge, daily notes, and reusable prompts, using GitHub Gists + AI. It provides a web/mobile companion experience to the [GistPad extension](https://aka.ms/gistpad) for VS Code, and the [GistPad MCP server](https://npmjs.com/gistpad-mcp). Collectively, these represent how I (and many others) manage my everyday knowledge, across clients and devices.

To get a sense of what it can do, check out the following screenshots, which illustrate its experience for editing/sharing notes, along with its AI capabilities, and an integrated news dashboard.
